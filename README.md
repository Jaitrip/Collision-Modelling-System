# Collision-Modelling-System
This is a collision modelling system I created for my A-Level computer science project. It allows you to model a two-dimensional or one-dimensional collision. You input values for mass and velocity of the objects and are given the momentum and kinetic energy before and after the collision. The program also gives you the option to view an general animation for the collision.
